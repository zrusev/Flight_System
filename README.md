# Flight_System
Sample flight system for tickets and reservations management which consumes the Schiphol's public airport [API](https://www.schiphol.nl/en/developer-center/) in order to obtain all flights information.

Using ReactJS on client's side and ExpressJS on server's, the application offers a public section for the arrival/departure flights and restricted one for the logged in users for tickets buying.

The administrative part of the system allows the administrator to modify or remove all already bought tickets.

Server included in repository.
